## 🚀 Next.js 14 Concepts Used in CodeSync

### ✅ **Core Features Implemented**

| **Concept** | **Implementation** | **File Location** |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **App Router** | Complete migration from Pages Router | `src/app/` |
| **Route Groups** | `(admin)` and `(root)` for organization | `src/app/(admin)/`, `src/app/(root)/` |
| **Dynamic Routes** | Meeting rooms with `[id]` parameter | `src/app/(root)/meeting/[id]/` |
| **Nested Layouts** | Different layouts per section | `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/(root)/layout.tsx` |
| **Server Components** | Default for data-heavy pages | Dashboard, recordings list |
| **Client Components** | Interactive features with `"use client"` | Meeting room, modals |
| **Middleware** | Route protection with Clerk | `src/middleware.ts` |
| **Server Actions** | Secure server operations | `src/actions/stream.actions.ts` |
| **Custom Hooks** | Reusable logic extraction | `src/hooks/` directory |
| **TypeScript** | Full type safety | Throughout project |
| **Font Optimization** | Local font loading | `src/app/layout.tsx` |
| **Hydration Management** | Preventing SSR/client mismatches | `src/hooks/useIsClient.ts` |

### 🎯 **Advanced Patterns**

- **Provider Composition**: Multiple context providers for different concerns
- **Real-time Integration**: Convex + Stream.io for live features  
- **Role-based Access Control**: Custom hooks + middleware protection
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling at multiple levels
- **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting, lazy loading, memoization

## 🗺️ Complete Route Structure

```
CodeSync Application Routes:
/                           → Home page (role-based content)
├── /dashboard             → Admin interview management  
├── /schedule              → Interview scheduling (interviewer only)
├── /meeting/[id]          → Dynamic meeting rooms
├── /recordings            → Interview recordings playback
└── (Protected by middleware + role-based access)
```

### **Route Implementation Details**

- **Static Routes**: Fixed paths like `/dashboard`, `/recordings`
- **Dynamic Routes**: Variable paths like `/meeting/[id]` for specific meetings
- **Route Groups**: `(admin)` and `(root)` for logical organization without URL impact
- **Nested Layouts**: Different UI shells for admin vs main app sections
- **Middleware Protection**: Automatic authentication for protected routes
