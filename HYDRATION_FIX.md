# Hydration Error Fix - CodeSync Interview Platform

## Problem Solved ✅

**Error**: `Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server`
**Location**: `<video>` element in `LandingPage` component

## Root Cause Analysis

The hydration error occurred because:

1. **Video Element with autoPlay**: The `<video>` element with `autoPlay` attribute behaves differently on server-side rendering vs client-side rendering
2. **State-Based Animations**: Using `useState` with initial `false` values for animations causes server/client HTML mismatch
3. **Client-Only Features**: Video autoplay and interactive animations only work in the browser, not during SSR

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created VideoPlayer Component

**File**: `src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx`

- Handles hydration by showing a placeholder during SSR
- Only renders the actual video after client-side mounting
- Prevents autoplay hydration issues

### 2. Created useIsClient Hook

**File**: `src/hooks/useIsClient.ts`

- Utility hook to detect when code is running on the client
- Prevents hydration mismatches for client-only features
- Reusable across the application

### 3. Updated LandingPage Component

**Changes**:

- Replaced direct `<video>` with `<VideoPlayer>` component
- Removed problematic state-based conditional rendering
- Used CSS-only animations instead of JavaScript-controlled animations

## Best Practices for Avoiding Hydration Errors

### ❌ What Causes Hydration Errors:

```tsx
// DON'T: Direct video with autoPlay
<video autoPlay loop muted>

// DON'T: State-based conditional rendering
{isVisible && <ComponentWithInteractivity />}

// DON'T: Date/time based rendering
{new Date().getHours() > 12 && <Afternoon />}
```

### ✅ How to Fix Hydration Errors:

```tsx
// DO: Use client-side mounting check
const isClient = useIsClient();
{isClient && <InteractiveComponent />}

// DO: Use CSS-only animations
className="animate-in fade-in duration-1000"

// DO: Create wrapper components for problematic elements
<VideoPlayer src="/video.mp4" />
```

## File Changes Summary

1. **src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx** - NEW: Hydration-safe video component
2. **src/hooks/useIsClient.ts** - NEW: Client-side detection hook
3. **src/components/LandingPage.tsx** - UPDATED: Fixed hydration issues

## Testing

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The hydration error should be resolved and the page should load without console errors.

## Additional Notes

- The video will now show a loading placeholder during SSR
- Animations are now CSS-only and hydration-safe
- The solution is reusable for other components with similar issues

## Common Hydration Error Scenarios in Next.js

1. **Media Elements**: `<video>`, `<audio>` with autoplay
2. **Date/Time**: Components that render different content based on current time
3. **Random Values**: Components using `Math.random()`
4. **Browser APIs**: Components using `window`, `document`, `localStorage`
5. **Third-party Libraries**: Components that manipulate DOM directly

All of these should be wrapped in client-side mounting checks or separate client components.
